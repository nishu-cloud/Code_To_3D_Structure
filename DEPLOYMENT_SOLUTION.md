# üöÄ Azure App Service Deployment Solution

## ‚ùå The Problem: "Repository does not exist for site CTS-VibeAppwe5112-3"

This error occurs when Azure App Service is trying to deploy from a Git repository that doesn't exist or isn't properly configured. This commonly happens when:

1. **Git deployment is enabled but no repository is configured**
2. **Previous deployment methods conflict with current setup**
3. **Azure portal still shows old deployment source settings**

## ‚úÖ The Solution: Clean ZIP Deployment

We've fixed this by implementing a **clean ZIP deployment approach** that bypasses Git deployment entirely.

### üîß What We Fixed

1. **Added PM2 dependency** for production process management
2. **Disabled Git deployment** to prevent repository errors
3. **Updated startup commands** for proper Node.js execution
4. **Included all necessary files** in deployment package
5. **Created comprehensive deployment scripts**

## üöÄ Quick Fix Steps

### Option 1: Use the Fixed Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the complete deployment script
.\deploy-complete.ps1
```

### Option 2: Manual Fix
If you want to fix an existing Azure App Service:

```bash
# 1. Disable Git deployment
az webapp deployment source delete --resource-group YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP --name YOUR_WEBAPP_NAME

# 2. Configure ZIP deployment
az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP --name YOUR_WEBAPP_NAME --src deploy.zip

# 3. Set startup command
az webapp config set --resource-group YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP --name YOUR_WEBAPP_NAME --startup-file "npm start"
```

## üìÅ Files Updated

- `package.json` - Added PM2 dependency and production scripts
- `deploy-azure.ps1` - Fixed deployment script
- `deploy-complete.ps1` - New comprehensive deployment script
- `deploy.bat` - Simple batch file for easy execution

## üîç Why This Happens

The "Repository does not exist" error typically occurs because:

1. **Azure Portal Configuration**: The portal might still show Git as the deployment source
2. **Previous Deployments**: Earlier deployments might have configured Git deployment
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Incomplete cleanup of previous deployment configurations
4. **Portal Cache**: Azure portal might be showing cached deployment information

## üéØ Prevention Tips

1. **Always use ZIP deployment** for Node.js applications
2. **Disable Git deployment** before configuring ZIP deployment
3. **Clear browser cache** when checking Azure portal
4. **Wait a few minutes** after deployment before checking status
5. **Use the deployment scripts** we've provided

## üö® If You Still See the Error

1. **Refresh the Azure portal** after a few minutes
2. **Check deployment source** in the Azure CLI:
   ```bash
   az webapp deployment source show --resource-group YOUR_GROUP --name YOUR_APP
   ```
3. **Force disable Git deployment**:
   ```bash
   az webapp deployment source delete --resource-group YOUR_GROUP --name YOUR_APP
   ```
4. **Redeploy using ZIP**:
   ```bash
   az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group YOUR_GROUP --name YOUR_APP --src deploy.zip
   ```

## üéâ Success Indicators

When the deployment is successful, you should see:
- ‚úÖ No more "Repository does not exist" errors
- ‚úÖ Deployment source shows as "Zip"
- ‚úÖ Your app is accessible at the Azure URL
- ‚úÖ No Git-related configuration in the deployment settings

## üìû Need Help?

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check the Azure CLI output for specific error messages
2. Verify your Azure subscription and permissions
3. Ensure you're logged into the correct Azure account
4. Try deploying to a new resource group to avoid conflicts

**Remember**: The key is to use ZIP deployment instead of Git deployment for Node.js applications on Azure App Service!
